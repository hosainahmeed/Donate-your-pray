        <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-bold">Bangladesh student protest???</div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>Bangladesh’s streets have again erupted with political violence. In early July, a university student
            protest began over Bangladesh's job quota system that disproportionately benefits the descendants of
            Bangladesh’s 1971 liberation war fighters, which many students view as unfair and outdated. Early last week,
            peaceful protests turned violent as police and ruling party supporters violently dispersed crowds. At least
            a half-dozen people died in early violence, including one man apparently shot by police with his hands
            raised, while pro- and anti-government students clashed around the country.</p>

          <p>With unrest and violence spiraling out of control on July 18, the government shut down internet and mobile
            networks, deployed the military and imposed a curfew, which all remained in place through the weekend. As of
            Sunday evening, news outlets reported that the protest’s death toll exceeded 130 and is likely to rise.</p>

          <p>
            USIP’s Geoffrey Macdonald discusses the drivers of the protests, why they are turning violent and what this
            tells us about the state of Bangladesh's politics.
          </p>

          <h1 class="text-xl font-bold">What is driving these protests?</h1>
          <p>
            Macdonald: Bangladesh’s quota system was the spark for these protests. Shortly after Bangladesh’s
            independence in 1971, the government established a system of quotas for government jobs that mandated 30
            percent of positions go to liberation war fighters. Over the decades, the benefit was modified to include
            the children and grandchildren of freedom fighters, persons with disabilities, ethnic minorities and others,
            totaling 56 percent of government jobs. In 2018, a similar student movement successfully compelled the
            government to scrap the quota system altogether. The issue was mostly settled until this June when
            Bangladesh’s high court ruled that ending the quota system was unconstitutional, effectively reinstating it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The government appealed the high court’s decision, but the prospect of the quota system’s return drove
            students to the street. The initial protests in early July were small but persistent and met with occasional
            violence from pro-government Awami League (AL) supporters, namely its student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League
            (BCL). The confrontation escalated when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina equated the protesters to “razakars,” a
            derogatory term (translated as “volunteer”) referring to those who collaborated with Pakistani forces to
            fight against Bangladesh’s independence in the 1971 war. In response, the protesters adopted the term as
            their own, declaring, “We are razakars” and calling the prime minister an autocrat.

        <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-bold">Untold stories of the uneducated</div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>According to Victor Hugo, ‘’He who opens a school door, closes a prison’’. He spoke as if systematic
            instructions were somewhat a palpable sense of emancipation. Well, Education has undeniably propelled the
            world into eras unimaginable. However, it has set humanity centuries backwards because society has become a
            prison in itself, impoverished of the things that truly matter and replaced them with fabricated standards
            of
            achievement.</p>

          <p>The education system has led to a systemized world which breeds the same narcissistic characters,
            generating
            similar thoughts from unchangeable syllabuses. High achievers of great intellect strive to earn top
            positions
            in modern industrial buildings erected from the ground by people considered prisoners deprived of life’s
            goodness, they care only to obtain power, vanity and material stitched by hands that know nothing about
            academia.</p>

          <p>White collar jobs are the reward after a four-year agonizing period of mastered information and scribbled
            notes, these jobs have left a legacy only to bellies they have fed, paving no way for social beneficial
            change
            or equality.</p>

          <p>Critics often say third world nations are living in vaults of ignorance due to their level of intellect,
            but
            is that really the case? Isn’t ignorance working tooth and nail for perishables that depict a life of
            middle-class, a taste that eschews its environment and cares nothing on the conditions and methods of their
            consumption. Only to surround one-self with aesthetic designs which have been marketed the same for decades.
          </p>

          <p>Majority of people are in an education system to secure a future they are uncertain of, rather than to
            create
            a future they will be happy with, so how do we close the doors to a prison, when school has become the
            prison?
            in which captives trek the walk of this system in uniforms, carrying bricks of books on their backs while
            sitting in rooms plastered with dull paint.</p>
