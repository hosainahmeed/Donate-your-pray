          <h1><span class="text-red-600 font-semibold">Question :</span>What sparked the student protest in Bangladesh in 2024? </h1>
          <p><span class="text-green-600 font-semibold">Answer :</span>The student protest in Bangladesh in 2024 was triggered by
            concerns over education reform and job opportunities for graduates. Students demanded better quality
            education, more transparency in public exams, and reforms in the job quota system, particularly for
            government jobs. The protests grew in intensity when students felt their demands were being ignored by the
            authorities.</p>

          <h1><span class="text-red-600 font-semibold">Question :</span>How severe was the 2024 flood in Bangladesh, and which regions
            were most affected? </h1>
          <p><span class="text-green-600 font-semibold">Answer :</span> The 2024 flood in Bangladesh was particularly severe,
            affecting millions of people across low-lying areas. The northern and northeastern regions, including
            districts like Sylhet, Kurigram, and Sunamganj, were most affected. Rivers overflowed due to heavy monsoon
            rains and melting glaciers from the Himalayas, causing widespread displacement, destruction of homes, loss
            of livestock, and damage to agriculture.</p>

          <h1><span class="text-red-600 font-semibold">Question :</span>What are the main challenges Bangladesh faces in reducing the
            number of uneducated children?</h1>
          <p><span class="text-green-600 font-semibold">Answer :</span>Despite progress in increasing primary school enrollment,
            Bangladesh faces several challenges in reducing the number of uneducated children. These include poverty,
            child labor, early marriages, lack of access to quality education in rural areas, and gender inequality.
            Many children drop out of school to support their families, and the quality of education in some regions is
            insufficient to keep students engaged.</p>

          <h1><span class="text-red-600 font-semibold">Question :</span>How has agriculture in Bangladesh adapted to the effects of
            climate change?</h1>
          <p><span class="text-green-600 font-semibold">Answer :</span> Agriculture in Bangladesh has had to adapt to the increasing
            effects of climate change, such as erratic weather patterns, floods, and droughts. Farmers are adopting more
            resilient farming techniques, including the cultivation of flood-resistant and drought-tolerant rice
            varieties. The government is also promoting sustainable practices such as crop diversification,
            water-efficient irrigation methods, and the use of technology to forecast weather and manage agricultural
            risks.</p>
